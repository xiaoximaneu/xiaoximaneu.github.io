      <h1>What do Birth Control Pills also control?</h1>
      <h2>Studies raise concerns about side effects -- depression, mood swings.</h2>
      <h3>By Xiaoxi Ma</h3>

<!--BEGINNING SECTION-->
<div class="container">
  <p>With abortion rights restricted in many parts of the country, women are taking a hard look at their contraception choices. 
    The term "roe v wade birth control" has seen a spike in Google searches since June 24, 
    when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
  </p>
  <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12000009"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
  <p> For years, the pill of birth control has been considered the most safe and effective, but is it really? 
    Studies show that while physically safe, it may increase your risk of having mood swings and depressions. </p>

</div>
<!--Denmark Study-->
<div class="container">
  <div class="horizontal_line"></div>
  <p>In 2016, <a href= "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2552796">a study from Denmark</a> did a nationwide research looking at the associations between the use of hormonal contraception and mood disturbances. 
  </p>
  <p>The study included more than one million women who are using the pill. “All women and adolescents aged 15 to 34 years who were living in Denmark were followed up from January 1, 2000, to December 2013,” as they wrote in the report, and all of these women’s health and prescription records data were collected from 1995 to 2013. 
  </p>
  <p>The study found a clear correlation between using the pill for birth control and depression among both adults and adolescents.
  </p>
  <p>The study use two indexes, "First Use of Antidepressants" and "First Diagnosis of Depression" to associate the risk of depression. 
    The charts below show how the risk of depression can be increased by using different types of pills. </p>

  <img src="./images/Allwomen_First Diagnosis of Depression.svg" alt="allwomen1" width="800" height="620" >
  <p>For all women, rates of depression climbed between 20% and 80%. 
    But the number for adolescents are more striking, climbed between 20% and 160%.

<!--basic info-->
<div class="container">
  <div class="horizontal_line"></div>
  <p>To break it down, here's some basic information that might help you understand it better. 
  </p>
  <p><b>What is the birth control pill?</b></p>
  <p>According to <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill">Planned Parenthood,</a> 
    Birth control pills are a “kind of medicine with hormones.” </p>
   <p>They come in a pack, and users of the pills need to take one pill at the same time every day. 
    If  you use the pill “perfectly,” 
    which means you strictly follow the instructions and 
    take the pill at the same time everyday,  then it’s 99% effective. In reality, it is hard to use it perfectly, so the pill is about 93% effective which means about seven out of one hundred pill users get pregnant each year.
  </p>
  <p><b>Two types of the pills</b></p>
  <p>
  • Combination pills or combined oral contraceptives, or COCs. COCs have both estrogen and progestin. They are the most common types of the pills.</p>
<p>• Progestin-only pills, or POPs or mini pills, which only have progestin.
</p>

<p><b>How does the pill work? </b></p>
<p>The hormones in the pill stop ovulation, according to Planned Parenthood. Ovulation is the process in which a mature egg is released from the ovary, and if the ovulation is stopped, there’s no egg being released therefore no pregnancy. </p>

<p><b>Hormones in the pills -- estrogen and progestin, what are those? </b></p>
<p>Estrogen and progesterone are the two predominant sex hormones for women, according to “This is your brain on birth control : the surprising science of women, hormones, and the law of unintended consequences” by Sarah Hill, a research psychologist and professor with expertise in women, health, and sexual psychology. 
</p>
<p>Estrogen coordinates conception, which happens in the follicular phase of women’s monthly cycle. It is responsible for “most of the things that we think about when we think about what makes women women.”
</p>
<p>Progesterone coordinates implantation, which happens in the luteal phase of women’s monthly cycle, which starts after ovulation. When progesterone is dominant, women tend to feel “hungrier, sleepier, and more relaxed. ”
</p>
<p>Progestin is a synthetic form of progesterone that is similar to the hormone produced naturally by the body, according to 
  <a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/progestin-only-hormonal-birth-control-pill-and-injection">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a>.</p>

<p><b>Hormonal effects are powerful, what does it control?</b></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://womensmentalhealth.org/posts/you-asked-do-oral-contraceptives-cause-mood-swings-or-depression/">an article</a> 
  from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Center for Women’s Mental Health, potential side effects of the pills include bloating, breast tenderness, and weight gain, and some users might experience depression or mood swings. 
</p>
<p>From the book we mentioned above, the author mentions that hormones influence “billions of cells at once, and exactly what they do to each of those billions of cells differs somewhat from woman to woman.”</p>

<p><b>Okay, how might my brain be affected when on the pill? Can it cause mood disorders like depression and anxiety?</b></p>
<p>According to a study called 
  <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17688380/">“Depression as a side effect of contraceptive pill,”</a> 
  estrogen appears to have a positive effect on depression, while progestins have a varied effect including worsening depression, and this depends on the type and dose of progesterone.</p>
<p>According to MGH, 
  clinically they find some women report depression or mood swings with the pills. 
  This group of women typically develop moderate to severe depressive symptoms shortly 
  after taking the pills and usually stop taking it very quickly -- before finishing the first pack. “While this is what we observe clinically, it is not a common side effect but is severe enough to lead to discontinuation.”</p>

<!--National Number-->
<div class="container">
  <div class="horizontal_line"></div>
  <p>On a global level, according to 
    <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/files/documents/2020/Jan/un_2019_contraceptiveusebymethod_databooklet.pdf">"UN contraceptive use by method 2019,"</a> 
    there are 151 million women aged 15 to 49 years using the pills in the year of 2019.  
    In the US, there are around 10.2 million pill users aged 15 to 49 years in the year of 2019.
  </p>
  <img src="./images/2019data.svg" alt="2019data" width="900" height="845" >
  <p>From 1994 to 2019, the number of people using the pills worldwide rose from 97 to 151 million.</p>
  <img src="./images/1994-2019growth.png" alt="94-19" width="600" height="745" >
  <p>As the use of birth control pills has increased, 
    there has been an ongoing discussion around their side effects.
  </p>
  <p>On TikTok, 
    there’s a hashtag named 
    <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/birthcontrolproblems?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc">#birthcontrolproblems</a> 
    that now have more than 400 million views. 
    Under this topic are countless videos of personal experience shared by pill users.

  <p>Reddit is another place where people talk about how the pills affect their mood. People started to post about this issue years ago and are still posting now.</p>

<div class="container">
  <p>Most birth control pills users probably won’t 
    have mood swing issues and depression, 
    statistically speaking. 
    However, for those who will be affected in this way, 
    the impact can be severe.
  </p>
  <p>“The side effect of the pill is not being talked enough,” commented someone on a #birthcontrolproblems video. </p>
