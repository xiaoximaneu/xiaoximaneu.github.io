      <h1>What do Birth Control Pills also control?</h1>

      <h2>
        With abortion rights restricted in many parts of the country, 
        women are taking a hard look at their contraception choices. 
        <br>
        For years, the pill has been considered the most safe and effective, 
        <br>
        but is it really?

<!--BEGINNING SECTION-->
<div class="container">
  <p>It all started with Tik Tok. 
    One day, a Tik Tok video appeared on my "For You Page", 
    which is the first page you land on when you open the app.
    It was about a girl talking about the changes in her body 
    when she was on birth controll pills. Out of curiosity, I clicked into a hashtag
    called <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTR9Nqb4a/">"#birthcontrolproblems"</a> 
    which has been 395.7 million times so far.
  </p>

  <p>  
    As you can see, this hashtag includes people talking about the side effects of the pills 
    that happened to them. In addition, when you open the packages of your birth control pills, you will see 
    a long list of side effects and things you need to be aware of. This all makes
  me wonder, for years, the pill has been considered the most safe and effective, 
  but is it really? </p>
