  <p>It all started with Tik Tok. 
    One day, a Tik Tok video appeared on my "For You Page", 
    which is the first page you land on when you open the app.
    It was about a girl talking about the changes in her body 
    when she was on birth controll pills. Out of curiosity, I clicked into a hashtag
    called <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTR9Nqb4a/">"#birthcontrolproblems"</a> 
    which has been 395.8 million times so far.
  </p>

  <p>  
    As you can see, this hashtag includes people talking about the side effects of the pills 
    that happened to them. In addition, when you open the packages of your birth control pills, you will see 
    a long list of side effects and things you need to be aware of. This all makes
  me wonder, for years, the pill has been considered the most safe and effective, 
  but is it really? </p>

  <p>Before we jump into investigation, let's first clearify What is birth control pills, or A.K.A oral contraception? 
  </p>
  <p>Accoridng to <a href= "https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/">CDC</a>, 
    there are two types of oral contraception:</p>
  <p>(----vis this later---)
    Combined oral contraceptives—Also called “the pill,” combined oral contraceptives contain the hormones estrogen and progestin. It is prescribed by a doctor. A pill is taken at the same time each day. If you are older than 35 years and smoke, have a history of blood clots or breast cancer, your doctor may advise you not to take the pill. Typical use failure rate: 7%.
  </p>
<p>(----vis this later---) Progestin only pill—Unlike the combined pill, the progestin-only pill (sometimes called the mini-pill) only has one hormone, progestin, instead of both estrogen and progestin. It is prescribed by a doctor. It is taken at the same time each day. It may be a good option for women who can't take estrogen. Typical use failure rate: 7%.
  </p>

  <p>First area that I want to look at is 
   <mark>how many women use the pill? Is the use growing?</mark> 
  </p>
  <p>From <a href="https://www-statista-com.ezproxy.neu.edu/study/40564/contraception-in-the-united-states-statista-dossier/">a Statista dossier</a> about contraception in the United States,
     in the year of 2019, there are 16% of women of reproductive age worldwide using pills.

  <p>Then, 
   <mark>how does the pill work? 
  </mark> 
  </p>
  <p>-- Choose to read Shorter Version or More detailed Explaination:(Use Js to display later)--</p>
  <p>(Shorter Version) According to <a href="https://www.bedsider.org/birth-control/the_pill">Bedsider</a>, an online birth control support network,
    most birth control pills work by releasing hormones that keep your ovaries from releasing eggs. 
    The hormones also thicken your cervical mucus, which helps to block sperm from getting to the egg in the first place.
  </p>
  <p>(More detailed) From "This is your brain on birth control : the surprising science of women, hormones, and the law of unintended consequences",
    a book written by Sarah E. Hill who is an associate professor of psychology and a leading researcher in the dynamic and rapidly expanding field of evolutionary psychology. 
    the most significant thing that the birth control pill does is prevent ovulation. 
    "No egg, no fertilization, no conception, no baby. Total genius."</p>
  <p> The book mentions that Women's ovulatory cycles are coordinated through a communication pathway in the body known as the HPG axis, which
    is made up of the brain, the pituitary gland, and your ovaries.</p>
  <p>"As with most things, your brain calls the shots with the HPG axis, but it does most of its work indirectly through the pituitary gland. The brain and the pituitary work together to coordinate the activities of the ovaries, which are the end point in this three-step communication pathway. Brain, pituitary, ovaries. Lather, rinse, repeat.”
  <p>It is important to understand women's menstrul circle when we are trying to figure it out how the pill works, 
    “... the first day of your cycle is the day that you start your period. 
    This is when the sex hormone crash that occurs at the end of a non-conceptive cycle causes your unused endometrium to bid your terus a fond adieu. 
    It also alerts the brain and pituitary to the fact that you are decidedly non-pregnant and that it's time to get cracking on another round of egg maturation and shoring up the uterine lining to start the whole process over again.”
  </p>
  <p>“When the brain needs to kick-start a new ovulatory cycle, it releases a hormone called GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone), which gets picked up by your pituitary gland. When the pituitary hears the brain whisper, “GnRH,” it passes its version of this message 
on to the ovaries through the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). 
These two pituitary hormones are then responsible for stimulating the ovaries to start maturing egg follicles, 
which then causes estrogen to be released. 
And after ovulation occurs, the ruptured egg follicle creates the corpus luteum, which causes progesterone to be released.”
</p>
<p>
“The HPG axis regulates all these activities using a series of feedback loops. 
To this end, each of the HPG axis's major players (brain, pituitary, ovaries) have special receptor sites that monitor hormone levels in the body. 
Measuring these hormones tells them each where they are in the cycle and what they need to do next.”
</p>
  <p>
“The latter is the point in the cycle that is mimicked by the pill. 
Rather than having dynamically changing hormones across the cycle like naturally cycling women do, 
pill-taking women get the same hormonal message delivered every day.”</p>

<p><mark>How do hormones change your body chemistry?</mark> 
 </p>
 <p>
  From “This is your brain on birth control : the surprising science of women, hormones, and the law of unintended consequences / Sarah E. Hill.”: 
 </p>

 <p>
  “The point is that hormones influence billions of cells at once, and exactly what they do to each of those billions of cells differs somewhat from woman to woman.”
 </p>
  
 <p>
  “Any hormone in your body—whether the real deal (we call these endogenous hormones) or one of the artificial (exogenous) hormones in the pill—will get picked up by all the cells in your body that have receptors for that hormone. They're able to turn billions of switches on and off throughout your body at one time, influencing which version of yourself your body creates. This includes whether or not you mature and release an egg (which is how the pill prevents you from getting pregnant), but also a whole bunch of other stuff, too. It’s sort of like dropping an atomic bomb on your house to blow out a candle. Dropping a bomb on a house will blow out a candle. It’s just that its effects are sufficiently . . . nonspecific . . . to make this a fairly unpopular way to deal with one's candle-extinguishing needs.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The majority of birth control pills are combination pills that contain artificial estrogen and a progestin (an artificial version of progesterone). And although most pills out there use the same artificial estrogen (ethinyl estradiol, again, synthesized from estrogen), about ten different versions of artificial progestins are in use. These different types of progestins are grouped into four different “generations,” based on the molecules from which they were derived and when they first appeared on the market.”
 </p>

 <P> (--- insert data vis for different generations of progestins, 
  progestins and estrogens in some frequently used hormonal contraceptives, etc
